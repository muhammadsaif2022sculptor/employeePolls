## About The App
employeePolls where every employee of company can access the application and create a poll with two proposed solutions. Employees can then vote on these solutions and see which solutions have the most votes. The process goes like this: An employee is asked a question in the form: ‚ÄúWould you rather [option A] or [option B] ?‚Äù. Answering "neither" or "both" is not possible.
